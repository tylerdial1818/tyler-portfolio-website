# Why I Stopped Using Notebooks for Production ML

Jupyter notebooks are fantastic for exploration and prototyping. But when it comes to production machine learning, they introduce a host of problems that make them more trouble than they're worth.

## The Hidden State Problem

Notebooks maintain hidden state. You can run cells out of order, delete cells that defined variables, and end up with a notebook that works on your machine but fails everywhere else.

## Testing is an Afterthought

Try writing unit tests for notebook code. It's possible, but it's painful. The notebook format wasn't designed for testability, and it shows.

## What I Use Instead

I've moved to a workflow that combines:

- **Python modules** for all core logic
- **Pytest** for testing
- **Hydra** for configuration management
- **DVC** for data versioning

The result is ML code that's reproducible, testable, and deployable.
