# Building Real-Time Dashboards with DuckDB + WASM

DuckDB's WebAssembly build opens up fascinating possibilities for client-side analytics. Instead of sending queries to a server, you can run SQL directly in the browser against datasets loaded into memory.

## Why Client-Side SQL?

The traditional dashboard architecture sends every interaction to a backend. With DuckDB-WASM, you can:

- **Eliminate round-trip latency** for sub-second query responses
- **Reduce server costs** by offloading computation to the client
- **Work offline** once the data is loaded

## The Architecture

The stack is straightforward: React for the UI, DuckDB-WASM for the query engine, and Apache Arrow for efficient data transfer between the two.

## Performance Results

For datasets under 100MB, the performance is remarkable. Aggregations over millions of rows complete in milliseconds, giving users a truly interactive analytical experience.
