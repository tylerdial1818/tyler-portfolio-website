# A Visual Guide to Bayesian Optimization

Bayesian optimization is one of the most elegant approaches to hyperparameter tuning. Instead of blindly searching a parameter space, it builds a probabilistic model of the objective function and uses it to make intelligent decisions about where to search next.

## The Core Idea

At its heart, Bayesian optimization maintains a **surrogate model** (typically a Gaussian Process) that approximates the true objective function. It then uses an **acquisition function** to decide which point to evaluate next.

## When to Use It

Bayesian optimization shines when:

- Your objective function is **expensive to evaluate**
- You have a **low-dimensional** parameter space
- You need a **global optimum**, not just a good-enough solution

## Key Takeaways

The beauty of Bayesian optimization is that it balances **exploration** (trying new regions) with **exploitation** (refining known good regions) in a principled way.
